## What is ATL .NET ?

Audio Tools Library .NET is the C# port of [the original ATL](http://mac.sourceforge.net/atl/), written in Pascal by the MAC Team (JÃ¼rgen Faul, Gambit and contributors).

It is aimed at giving C# developers a native, portable and easy-to-use library to access and read data from various digital audio formats.

As a showcase, I have used ATL.NET as a cornerstone to build [Ethos Cataloger](https://trello.com/b/ZAzRjbXZ/ethos-cataloger), a digital music cataloging software written entirely in C#.


## What is NOT ATL .NET ?

Audio Tools Library .NET is not

* a standalone application : it is a library aimed at being used by developers to build software

* an audio music player : it gives access to various properties and metadata (see below for the comprehensive list), but does not process audio data into an audible signal


## Why open source ?

ATL has been open source since its creation. The ATL 2.3 source written in Pascal language is still out there on Sourceforge !

By publicly sharing the result of their work, the MAC team has helped many developers to gain tremendous time in creating audio tools.

As a fellow audiophile and developer, I'm proudly extending and improving their initial contribution to the open source community.


## Why would I want to use ATL while TagLib is out there ?

* ATL is a __fully native C# implementation__, which makes portability trivial if your app is already based on .NET or Mono frameworks

* ATL features a __flexible logging system__ which allows you to catch and record audio file reading/writing incidents into your app

* ATL supports __more audio formats than TagLib, including video game audio formats (SPC, PSF, VGM, GYM)__

* ATL supports __[chapters](https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet/wiki/Focus-on-Chapter-metadata)__ natively

* ATL supports BEXT, LIST INFO and iXML metadata in RIFF / WAV files

* ATL supports __Playlists and Cuesheets__


## How to use it ?  Which platforms and .NET/Mono versions does ATL run on ?

The ATL library runs on .NET Core 2.0+ / .NET Standard 2.0+ / .NET Framework 3.0+ / Mono 2.0+

ATL unit tests run on .NET Framework 4.5+

The library and its tests have been maintained on Visual Studio Express 2012, 2015 and 2017 Community

Please refer to the [Code snippets section of the Documentation](https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet/wiki/3.-Usage-_-Code-snippets) for quick usage


## What kind of data can ATL actually read ? From which formats ?

__SUPPORTED AUDIO FORMATS AND TAGGING STANDARDS__

NB1 : Empty cells mean "not applicable for this audio format"

NB2 : All metadata is read according to Unicode/UTF-8 encoding when applicable, which means any "foreign" character (japanese, chinese, cyrillic...) __will__ be recognized and displayed properly

(1) : ATL reads ID3v2.2-2.4 tags, but only writes ID3v2.4 tags

(2) : all sample names appear on the track's Comment field. Track title only is editable

(3) : MIDI meta events appear on the track's Comment field

(4) : Support for BEXT, LIST INFO and iXML chunks




__DETECTED FIELDS__

* Audio data (from audio data) : Bitrate, Sample rate, Duration, VBR, Codec family
* Standard Metadata (from tags) : Title, Artist, Album Artist, Composer, Conductor, Description, Comment, Genre, Track number, Disc number, Year, Album, Rating, Publisher, Copyright, Original album, Original artist, Embedded pictures, [Chapters](https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet/wiki/Focus-on-Chapter-metadata)
* Custom Metadata : any other field that might be in the tag is readable __and__ editable by ATL

__SUPPORTED PLAYLISTS FORMATS :__ ASX, B4S, FPL (experimental), M3U, M3U8, PLS, SMIL (including WPL and ZPL), XSPF

__SUPPORTED CUESHEETS FORMATS :__ CUE


## What is the roadmap of ATL.NET ?

* Support for Broadcast wave metadata : aXML and XMP
* Support for other audio file formats : Speex, Theora, Audible
* Connectors to __other library file formats__ (e.g. iTunes)


## Does ATL.NET include code authored by other people ?

ATL.NET is based on :

* Audio Tools Library 2.3  by Jurgen Faul, Mattias Dahlberg, Gambit, MaDah and Erik Stenborg (code ported from Pascal to C# and refactored)

* MIDI class 1.5 by Valentin Schmidt & Michael Mlivoncic (code ported from PHP to C# and refactored)
